Create a new empty string
Iterate through the array of strings
  - For each iteration, append the value to the empty string */

/* Given an array of integers

Create a new empty array
Iterate through the array of integers
  - Append the first integer into the empty array

Create a counter starting at 0
Split the string into an array
Iterate over the array

    - If they match, add one to the counter
    - If they do not, skip
  - When the counter reaches 3, return the index value of the current iteration */

  Create a new empty array
  Begin iterating against the length of the arrays
    - For each iteration, append a number from the first array to the empty array
